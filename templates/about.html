          <h5 class="card-title">Coffee plants</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Coffee harvest in Coorg is an annual affair confined to 2-3 months of certain periods of each calendar year. A farmer’s life is entirely dependent on the amount of coffee fruit he is able to harvest during this annual harvest season, as indicated by the blossom. A smaller than possible harvest will undermine his carefully laid out financial plans, which include, meeting the expenses of the family, farm and loan repayments.
            The coffee produced by a farm is a result of properly scheduled cultural operations carried out throughout a year. The major types of sustenance activities include fertilization, shade regulation, bush training, soil cultivation and so on. Whilst these are very important in the final quantity and quality of the produce, blossoms generated by the plant in the crucially dry period of February-March, have the most telling effect of coffee fruit harvested in the following year.

          <h5 class="card-title">Coffee Blossoms</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Blossoms are flowers produced on the coffee plant. These are borne on the plant as a result of water received by artificial irrigation or natural showers. Natural rainfall in adequate quantities is the more preferred form of moisture.
            Natural showers during the period of February-March are not guaranteed either in frequency or quantity, hence prompting many of the progressive farmers to adopt artificial irrigation.
            Artificial irrigation is a process by which diesel engines pump up water from storage tanks constructed for this purpose, and the water is delivered to the plants by sprinklers positioned above the bushes.</p>

          <p class="card-text">‌Coffee fruit, also known as coffee cherry or coffee berry, is a small, round stone fruit produced by the coffee plant. It is about the size of a grape and grows in bunches on the coffee plant. When raw, it is green in color and turns into a deep red, reddish-purple, or yellowish-red color as it ripens. The coffee bean lies within the pit of the stone fruit. Raw coffee beans are extracted from the fruit for processing and roasting to make coffee, while the fruit is discarded</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">More about Coffee Fruit</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Coffee fruits are often called coffee cherries or coffee berries. Coffee seeds (coffee beans) form inside of coffee fruits. Coffee fruits have long been recognized as having nutritional and healthenhancing potential including antioxidant capacity. However, the cherry is highly perishable, and until recently, has been prone to rapidly develop extensive bacterial contamination and molds that generate toxic secondary metabolites known as mycotoxins. Consequently, the coffee fruit, other than
            its seed (coffee beans), has traditionally been considered waste material unsuitable for consumption,
            and has typically been discarded or used as fertilizer.</p>
